Real-time WebGL2 ferrofluid simulation on a procedural circuit board.

**[Live Demo](https://aleiby.github.io/webslime/)**

Drag to move the swarm. Arrow keys also work.

## What is this?

An interactive simulation of cone-driven slime mold flowing over a procedurally generated PCB surface. Features include:

- Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion patterns that evolve in real time
- Shadow-mapped heightfield rendering with PBR materials
- Procedural PCB terrain with chips, capacitors, pin arrays, and paint drops
- Tilt-shift depth-of-field blur
- GPU-accelerated flow field and thickness advection

Everything runs in a single HTML file with no dependencies -- just WebGL2.
